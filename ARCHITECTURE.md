## ADR-001: Deployment Platform Selection

**Date:** 2025-06-30  
**Status:** Decided  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context
Need to select deployment platforms for frontend, backend, and database that provide:
- Low cost / free tier options
- Reliable performance for real-time chat application
- Ease of deployment and maintenance
- Scalability for future growth

### Decision
**Selected Stack: Vercel + Railway**
- **Frontend:** Vercel
- **Backend:** Railway (Node.js + Socket.IO + Fastify)
- **Database:** Railway PostgreSQL
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO WebSockets

### Rationale for Backend Choice

**Why Railway instead of Supabase Edge Functions:**

**Technical Compatibility:**
- Our existing Socket.IO server requires persistent WebSocket connections
- Supabase Edge Functions are stateless and short-lived (incompatible with Socket.IO)
- Converting to Supabase real-time would require complete rewrite of real-time logic

**Development Consistency:**
- Same codebase runs locally, in CI/CD, and production
- No need to maintain separate implementations
- Faster development and easier debugging

**Single-Vendor Architecture:**
- Database and backend in same datacenter (low latency)
- No cross-vendor network connections or security complexity
- Simpler deployment, monitoring, and billing
- Better utilization of Railway's $5/month free credit

### Alternatives Considered

#### Backend Hosting Platform Comparison

| Platform | Node.js Support | WebSocket Support | Free Tier Quality | Always-On | Database Included | Deployment |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Railway** ‚≠ê | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Native | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ PostgreSQL | Git-based |
| **Render** | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Native | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ùå Sleeps 15min | ‚úÖ PostgreSQL | Git-based |
| **Heroku** | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Native | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ùå No free tier | ‚úÖ Add-ons | Git-based |
| **Vercel + Supabase** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Functions | ‚ùå Incompatible | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ PostgreSQL | Git-based |

#### Detailed Platform Analysis

**1. Railway** ‚≠ê **SELECTED**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - **Best free tier for Node.js**: $5/month credit covers most small-medium apps
  - **Excellent WebSocket support**: Native Socket.IO compatibility, no configuration needed
  - **Zero-config deployments**: Connect GitHub repo, auto-deploys on push
  - **Included PostgreSQL**: Database included in free tier (1GB storage, 1GB RAM)
  - **Always-on services**: No sleeping, maintains WebSocket connections
  - **Environment variables**: Easy secret management and configuration
  - **Real-time logs**: Built-in monitoring and debugging tools
  - **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
  - **Same datacenter**: Database and backend co-located for low latency

- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - **Newer platform**: Less mature than Heroku (founded 2020)
  - **Credit limit**: $5/month free tier limit (pay-as-you-go after)
  - **Limited regions**: Fewer deployment regions than major cloud providers

- üí∞ **Pricing:**
  - **Free tier**: $5/month usage credit (covers ~0.1 vCPU, 0.1GB RAM + database)
  - **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.000463/GB-sec RAM, $0.000231/vCPU-sec
  - **PostgreSQL**: Included in usage credit

**2. Render**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - **Good free tier**: 750 hours/month compute time
  - **Native WebSocket support**: Works out of the box with Socket.IO
  - **Auto-deploy from GitHub**: Simple Git-based deployment
  - **Free SSL**: Automatic HTTPS certificates
  - **PostgreSQL included**: Free database tier available

- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - **Services sleep**: Free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
  - **Cold start delays**: 30+ seconds to wake up, breaks WebSocket connections
  - **Limited compute**: 0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM on free tier
  - **Poor for real-time**: Sleeping breaks persistent connections

- üí∞ **Pricing:**
  - **Free tier**: 750 hours/month, but services sleep
  - **Always-on**: $7/month minimum for persistent services

**3. Heroku**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - **Mature platform**: 15+ years, very stable and well-documented
  - **Excellent add-on ecosystem**: Redis, monitoring, etc.
  - **WebSocket support**: Works well with Socket.IO

- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - **No free tier**: Removed November 2022
  - **Expensive**: $7/month minimum for basic dyno
  - **Services still sleep**: Even paid dynos sleep without traffic

**4. Vercel + Supabase (Original Plan)**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - **Excellent for static sites**: Best-in-class frontend hosting
  - **Great database features**: Supabase provides auth, APIs, real-time

- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - **Edge Functions incompatible**: Can't run persistent WebSocket servers
  - **Would require complete rewrite**: Converting Socket.IO to Supabase real-time
  - **Cross-vendor complexity**: Managing services across multiple platforms

**5. AWS Free Tier**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - Comprehensive services (S3, CloudFront, EC2, Lambda, RDS)
  - 750 hours/month EC2 t2.micro
  - 1TB CloudFront data transfer
  - Industry standard, highly scalable
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - High complexity, steep learning curve
  - Manual setup and configuration required
  - Costs escalate quickly after free tier
  - 12-month time limit on free tier
  - Real-time features require additional services (API Gateway WebSocket)

**5. Google Cloud Platform**
- ‚úÖ **Pros:**
  - f1-micro Compute Engine instance always free
  - Cloud Functions with 2M invocations/month
  - Firestore with real-time capabilities
  - Good integration between services
- ‚ùå **Cons:**
  - Cloud SQL not in always-free tier
  - Complex networking and security setup
  - Requires GCP expertise
  - Limited storage in free tier (1GB Firestore)

### Implementation Plan
