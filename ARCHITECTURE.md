| **Google Cloud** | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Limited | High | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⚠️ Complex setup |
| **Render (All-in-one)** | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | ✅ PostgreSQL | Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⚠️ Custom |

#### Detailed Platform Analysis

**1. AWS Free Tier**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Comprehensive services (S3, CloudFront, EC2, Lambda, RDS)
  - 750 hours/month EC2 t2.micro
  - 1TB CloudFront data transfer
  - Industry standard, highly scalable
- ❌ **Cons:**
  - High complexity, steep learning curve
  - Manual setup and configuration required
  - Costs escalate quickly after free tier
  - 12-month time limit on free tier
  - Real-time features require additional services (API Gateway WebSocket)

**2. Google Cloud Platform**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - f1-micro Compute Engine instance always free
  - Cloud Functions with 2M invocations/month
  - Firestore with real-time capabilities
  - Good integration between services
- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Cloud SQL not in always-free tier
  - Complex networking and security setup
  - Requires GCP expertise
  - Limited storage in free tier (1GB Firestore)

**3. Railway**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - All-in-one platform (frontend, backend, database)
  - Simple deployment from GitHub
  - Built-in PostgreSQL
  - $5 monthly credit in free tier
- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Credit-based model may not be sustainable long-term
  - Less mature than other platforms
  - Custom real-time implementation required
  - Limited to single platform vendor

**4. Render**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Good free tier for static sites and web services
  - Built-in PostgreSQL option
  - Simple deployment process
  - No time limits on free tier
- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Less generous free tier than competitors
  - Slower cold starts on free tier
  - Limited real-time capabilities
  - Smaller ecosystem

**5. Vercel + Supabase (Selected)**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - **Vercel:** Best-in-class React deployment, automatic optimizations
  - **Supabase:** PostgreSQL + real-time + auth + APIs in one platform
  - Both have generous, permanent free tiers
  - Real-time WebSocket support built-in
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Auto-generated REST and GraphQL APIs
  - Built-in authentication system
  - Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- ⚠️ **Considerations:**
  - Two separate platforms to manage
  - Supabase is newer (but PostgreSQL is mature)
  - Free tier limits: 500MB DB, 5GB bandwidth/month

### Rationale

**Why Vercel + Supabase:**

1. **Developer Experience:** Both platforms prioritize DX with simple deployment and excellent documentation
2. **Real-time First:** Supabase is built for real-time applications with WebSocket support out of the box
3. **Cost Effective:** Both offer generous free tiers without time limits
4. **Chat-Specific Benefits:**
   - Real-time message synchronization
   - Built-in user authentication
   - PostgreSQL for reliable message storage
   - Automatic API generation
5. **Future-Proof:** Easy to scale and add features like file uploads, user profiles, etc.
6. **Low Complexity:** Minimal DevOps overhead compared to AWS/GCP

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Basic Setup**
- Deploy React client to Vercel
- Setup Supabase project with PostgreSQL
- Configure real-time message synchronization

**Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
- Implement Supabase Auth for user management
- Add message persistence with proper schema
- Setup Row Level Security policies

**Phase 3: Production Ready**
- Custom domains and SSL
- Performance monitoring
- Backup strategies

### Success Metrics
- Deployment time < 5 minutes
- Zero cold start issues for real-time features
- Free tier sustainability for development/testing
- Easy scaling path for production use

## ADR-002: CI/CD Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-06-30  
**Status:** Planned  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Implementation Phases

#### **Phase 1: Basic CI Pipeline**
**What we'll build:**
1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. **Quality Gates Pipeline:**
   - Install dependencies (all workspaces)
   - TypeScript checks (shared, client, server)
   - ESLint checks (all packages)
   - Jest unit tests (client + server)
   - Playwright E2E tests
   - Production build verification

**Key Features:**
- Trigger on PRs and pushes to master
- Node.js version matrix for compatibility
- Dependency caching for performance
- Parallel jobs where possible
- Clear failure reporting

**Benefits:**
- Catch issues before they reach main branch
- Ensure all tests pass in clean environment
- Verify builds work across Node versions
- Automated quality enforcement

#### **Phase 2: Advanced CI Features**

**2.1 Code Quality Metrics**
- Code coverage reporting
- Bundle size analysis for client
- Performance regression detection
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

**2.2 Branch Protection**

- Embed rich messages with build status
- Bot commands for deployment triggers

### Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Immediate Value)**
1. Basic CI pipeline with quality gates
2. Slack and Discord notifications
3. Branch protection rules
